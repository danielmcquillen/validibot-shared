## Adding a New Validator Schema

If you're adding envelope models for a new validator type:

1. Create a new directory under `validibot_shared/` (e.g., `validibot_shared/myvalidator/`)
2. Define your input/output models in `models.py`
3. Create typed envelope subclasses in `envelopes.py`
4. Add tests under `tests/`

See the existing `energyplus/` and `fmu/` directories for examples.

## Code Style

This project uses [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) for linting and
formatting. Run `uv run ruff check . --fix` to auto-fix issues and
